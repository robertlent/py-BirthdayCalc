# Birthday Calculator

Birthday Calculator is a Python application that determines if the user's birthday has passed, and if so, how long ago it passed, as well as how long until their next birthday.

The application asks the user for the numerical month and day of their birth, and will not allow them to enter any invalid entries for either. The user is limited to entering 1 through 12 for the month and 1 through the last day of their birth month for the day.

### Requirements
The application requires Python 3 be installed on your computer. After downloading and unzipping the files, you can then run the command 'python birthday.py' from inside of the unzipped folder.
